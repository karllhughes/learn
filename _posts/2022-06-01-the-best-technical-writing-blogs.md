[Technical writing](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-writing-for-engineers) is the art of explaining complex technical topics in simple language for readers at different experience levels. [Technical writers](https://draft.dev/learn/becoming-a-remote-technical-writer) can create anything from manuals, articles, and tutorials to whitepapers, ebooks, and product descriptions for various organizations. Before I became a technical writer, I studied a number of tech blogs and learned about various writing opportunities in the tech industry so that I could better understand how to do it. 

This isn’t always easy work. You need to be technical enough to write about a topic but not too technical for the end-user. For example, if a quality assurance engineer wants to learn about machine learning, your article needs to explain machine learning in simple terms and focus on the basic concepts, not the algorithms and frameworks. 

If you’ve chosen to be a tech writer, you need to stay on top of the latest developments in the tech world. An excellent way to do this is to read good technical blogs. You can study other tech writers’ work to see how they write about tech-heavy topics both concisely and effectively.   

In this article, I offer my recommendations for the fifteen best technical writing blogs that you should follow. I’ve ranked and graded these blogs on the following criteria:

* writing quality 
* consistency
* longevity 
* technical depth

These recommendations are a mix of highly specific tech blogs for a certain niche, beginner-level blogs, and general-market blogs. Reading them will help you improve your understanding and writing skills.

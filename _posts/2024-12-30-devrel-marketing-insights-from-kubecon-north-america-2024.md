KubeCon North America 2024 recently wrapped up, and our CEO, Karl Hughes, and Account Director, Clayton Kast, were on the ground connecting with leaders in DevRel and developer marketing. 

The insights and connections made at KubeCon are always a great indicator of the future of technical marketing in the Kubernetes space, so in this post, I'll share the key takeaways from their conversations with DevRel and Marketing leaders.

## The Kubernetes Ecosystem Is Maturing

One of the main takeaways from KubeCon was the clear sense that the Kubernetes ecosystem is maturing. Karl observed that the Kubernetes space has become quite robust, with a wide array of tools and providers now available. This abundance of options, while beneficial for developers, also presents a challenge for companies trying to differentiate themselves in an increasingly crowded market.

This maturity also means that companies are now shifting their focus from simply getting started with Kubernetes to using it effectively. 

> "Previously, you saw a bunch of new faces popping up, but they were focused on new iterations and how to use the existing Kubernetes ecosystem."–Clayton Kast, Account Director at Draft.dev

Now, we're seeing a lot of similar iterations that are competing against each other, highlighting the need for companies to clearly define their unique value proposition.

## AI Is Shifting to Practical Applications

While there was a lot of talk about artificial intelligence (AI) at KubeCon, the conversations were notably different from previous years. Instead of focusing on the hype and potential of AI, the discussions centered on its practical applications and how it can be used to solve real-world problems for developers. Essentially, the focus has shifted from "what could AI do?" to "how can AI help us right now?".

As Karl mentioned, the primary focus of AI integration seems to be on workflow improvement and enhancing user interfaces. The main tasks companies are actively exploring AI for include:

* **Analyzing Observability and Other Data:** Processing large volumes of observability data and other types of data to help developers identify patterns, anomalies, and potential issues more quickly and efficiently.
* **Automating Routine Developer Tasks:** Automating tasks that junior developers often handle, such as creating manifest files and other Kubernetes configuration files.
* **Data Processing and Pipelining:** Providing tools for managing high volumes of data, including data pipelining and other data-related activities.

These examples show that AI is rapidly becoming a practical tool for developers, rather than just a buzzword. The focus is now on how AI can be used to make developers' lives easier and more productive.

## Community Engagement Remains a Key Focus

Community engagement remains a key focus for companies in the developer space. There's a growing desire to build strong communities around products within platforms like Slack and Discord, and to understand the "secrets" of successful communities.

This suggests that companies are increasingly recognizing the importance of building strong relationships with their developer communities, rather than just focusing on marketing and sales, and I couldn't agree more on this point. 

At Draft.dev, we've seen firsthand, through our work with over 100 devtool companies, that focusing on building long-term engagement within a community is the most effective way to build trust around a product. It's a time-consuming process, but in the developer space, where traditional sales and marketing tactics often fall flat, building trust is the only way to truly encourage developers to adopt your product.

## Marketing Tactics Are Evolving

On the sales and marketing front, companies seem to be increasingly exploring different tactics to differentiate themselves. One notable trend is the rise of paid advertising in the developer space. This could be driven by the increasing difficulty of reaching developers organically, as well as the growing sophistication of paid advertising platforms. 

> "I've also heard more talk of paid ads in the developer space in the last year or two." – Karl Hughes, CEO of Draft.dev

In addition to paid advertising, another trend that's gaining momentum is the growing popularity of podcasts. Podcasts offer an opportunity to engage with developers on a deeper level, providing a platform for in-depth discussions, technical insights, and personal stories. 

> "Companies are focusing on podcasts a lot more than they usually do."–Clayton Kast, Account Director at Draft.dev

This shows that companies are exploring and trying out different content formats to reach their target audience.

## Multicloud Accessibility Gains Momentum

Multicloud accessibility is becoming easier, even for smaller companies. This is driven by the desire to take advantage of the best features of each platform and achieve cost savings. 

> "In the last few years it's become easier and easier for smaller companies to have redundancy multicloud setups."– Karl Hughes, CEO at Draft.dev

This indicates that companies are becoming more strategic about their cloud infrastructure, choosing the best platform for each specific task.

## Kubernetes Specialization Is Becoming a Clear Trend

As the Kubernetes ecosystem matures, companies are not only starting to "pick a lane" and specialize in a particular area, but they're also strategically considering acquisitions to fill functional gaps in their offerings. This trend shows that being a generalist in the Kubernetes space is becoming increasingly challenging and that companies are looking to either specialize or acquire the expertise they lack.

Seeing more and more acquisitions in the Kubernetes space, it seems like a clear indicator that companies are recognizing the need to focus on their core competencies, specialize in a particular area of the Kubernetes ecosystem, and strategically acquire companies to fill any functional gaps.

## Final Thoughts

As we look ahead, it will be fascinating to see which AI implementations gain traction and become widely adopted, and which ones fade away over time. The Kubernetes ecosystem is still evolving, and the practical applications of AI are just beginning to emerge. It will also be interesting to see how companies leverage their multicloud setups to optimize their configurations and cost savings for greater efficiency.

[A Smart Bear](https://blog.asmartbear.com/) is simply terrific. From the web page design to the well-crafted articles, this blog has everything you need to get started in SaaS. 

Jason’s long-form articles are well-researched and structured. He also uses a conversational tone with a witty touch, which makes his SaaS marketing blog interesting and memorable.

Just be prepared for a slightly longer read. These articles aren’t labeled ‘long-form’ without reason.

Total Score - 5

### 5. Noah Kagan

![Noah Kagan](/learn/assets/posts/best-saas-blogs-8.png "Noah Kagan")

Noah is a master of social media and viral growth, but fair warning: he can be a bit brash. Plus, not every article is about B2B SaaS marketing. If you don’t mind an occasional skincare guide, this is an excellent blog worth adding to your arsenal.

Are you a product marketing specialist looking for SaaS resources? Look no further than the [Silicon Valley Product Group](https://www.svpg.com/articles/) (or SVPG). This popular blog offers detailed articles covering SaaS pricing, product, and more.

[Marty Cagan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cagan), the ex-Senior Vice President of eBay, has a hand in crafting each blog article. They’re extremely high quality, but only published a few times per month. Expect to wait a few weeks between releases.

* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score - 4.5

[Andrew Chen’s SaaS marketing blog](https://andrewchen.substack.com/) offers a relatively large library of articles providing expert opinions and reviews on SaaS growth. This is a must-read if you want resources on SaaS metrics, bootstrapping and fundraising, and making data-driven decisions.

Unfortunately, most of Andrew’s articles are written in fairly technical language. Plus, the blog isn’t always regularly updated. But if you’re an established SaaS marketer who’s willing to wait for articles, you’ll find this blog to be a veritable goldmine.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 4
* Longevity - 5

### 10. GTMnow

![GTMnow](/learn/assets/posts/best-saas-blogs-1.png "GTMnow")

[GTMnow](https://gtmnow.com/tag/articles/), probably best known as [Sales Hacker](https://gtmnow.com/sales-hacker-is-re-acquired-by-gtmfund-re-branded-as-gtmnow/) before the rebrand, collects candid insights from go-to market professionals. This includes sales reps, marketers, and customer success teams dealing with SaaS products in a variety of fields.

There’s a lot to love about GTMnow: the interface is intuitive and the resources are top-notch. The only problem is, their articles aren’t always consistent. There’s no set cadence for when blog posts get released.

* Writing Quality - 5
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 5
* Technical Depth - 4
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score - 4.2

### 11. Justin Jackson’s Blog

Justin’s blog provides readers with ample information on SaaS product, development, and growth. Compared to the other SaaS blogs on this list, however, Justin doesn’t update quite as often.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 4
* Longevity - 4
* Technical Depth - 4

Total Score - 4

### 12. Kalungi

![Kalungi](/learn/assets/posts/best-saas-blogs-10.png "Kalungi")

If you’re in the business of B2B SaaS marketing, you’ll love the [Kalungi blog](https://www.kalungi.com/blog). It offers a regular stream of dense, consistent articles covering demand generation, strategy and planning, and more.

The downside is, Kalungi targets a technical audience. If you’re not familiar with B2B yet, some of the articles may go over your head. 

Plus, Kalungi is a SaaS marketing platform, so it’s not necessarily unbiased material. This certainly isn’t a dealbreaker here, but it’s something to consider while reading each blog.

* Writing Quality - 5
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 3
* Technical Depth - 5

Total Score - 4

## How We Ranked the Best SaaS Marketing Blogs

We used a two-step process to rank the best SaaS marketing blogs.

First, we collected reviews and recommendations from SaaS marketers and business owners. Then, we read through each blog and selected those with the best:

* Writing Quality: No one likes a confusing or poorly written article. We’ve only included blogs that are clear, valuable, and well-organized.
* Consistency: Does the blog owner publish regularly? Are they relevant, regular, and easy to access?
* Longevity: The best SaaS bloggers don’t wear out their welcome — they know how to fit enough context in each piece.
* Technical Depth: How well-researched and technical are the articles? Do they provide unique angles or personal insights?
* Broad Usefulness: A good blog provides some useful information, but a great blog offers actionable and practical advice. You can use each blog as a stepping stone to improve your skills and level up your business.

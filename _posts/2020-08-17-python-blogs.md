Python is one of [the most popular programming languages](http://pypl.github.io/PYPL.html) in use today. It's become a favorite for both experienced developers and those just starting out, thanks to its winning combination of power and user-friendliness. Since Python is a core technology in booming fields like data science, machine learning, and AI, [its usage will likely continue to rise](https://github.blog/2023-03-02-why-python-keeps-growing-explained/).

![Python Google Trend](/learn/assets/posts/python-blogs-1.png "Python Google Trend")

But as its popularity increases, so too does the number of Python blogs competing for your attention.

That is why I went on a journey to find the best Python blogs on the internet. I looked for blogs that showcased deep technical knowledge, were relatively easy to comprehend, publish content consistently, and have stood the test of time.

During this process, I used the same approach for analyzing and comparing common qualities (or deficiencies) in each of the Python programming blogs.

I looked at the depth of each blog’s [technical content](https://draft.dev/learn/technical-content) and the usefulness of that content. I read a few posts from start to finish to get a sense of the [writing quality](https://draft.dev/learn/5-steps-to-a-quality-edit-for-your-technical-blog) and comprehensibility. Finally, I looked at how consistently the python bloggers publish new content and did some digging to learn how long each site has been around.

Before we dive into each one individually, here are the 23 best python blogs at a glance:

Reddit is a massive crowd-sourced message board with a ‘subreddit’ specifically dedicated to Python, among other programming languages. “r/Python,” est. 2008, is probably one of the best programming subreddits you can find on the topic of Python. It’s composed of a large community of members (>500K) with varying degrees of proficiency who share dozens of questions, solutions, and ideas every day. As is the case with some message boards, there are no sub-categories or sub-subreddits, so all posts are centralized in one location. Writing is often clear and high quality, depending on the writer; however, all posts are subjective and contributed solely by other Reddit users, so readability, clarity, and even language fluency does not always meet expectations.

Mouse vs. Python is a personal blog that shares content on a variety of topics in both written and video formats. A recurring post type seems to be one-on-one interviews with developers, which may be less useful to current programmers than tutorials and technical breakdowns. That’s not to say the technical depth is not above average, as both formats provide moderate expertise and value. The blog has been around since 2008 and has established itself as a reliable publisher of content, as readers can typically expect 5-15 new posts every month.

[RSS](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/rss.xml), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nedbat)

![Ned Batchelder](/learn/assets/posts/python-blogs-4.png "Ned Batchelder")

Ned Batchelder is the personal blog of veteran Python developer Ned Batchelder. This is one of the oldest and most original Python bloggersrom the early 2000s. There’s plenty of content dating back nearly 20 years; some topics being detailed breakdowns, others simple one paragraph tips. Ned keeps his content simple with no frills. Blog posts are clear enough to get the point across while sacrificing some elegance. The only improvement I can recommend would be more frequent posts; you’d be lucky to get one per month. Fortunately, there’s a huge backlog of posts to study up on, and it comes directly from the mind of a programmer who’s experimented with and written Python longer than most.

Python Tips is a personal blog that explores technical applications and nuances of Python. You’ll find a large collection of articles, guides, explanations, and deep-dives, sure to be useful for most Python programmers. Yasoob, the blog’s sole writer since 2013, showcases a strong technical grasp of the whats, wheres, whens, whys, and hows to walk the reader through complex concepts with clarity and detail. Its usefulness is hamstrung by periods of sporadic posting, followed by 2-3 months of silence. Like many Python blogspots, the articles are informative and packed with data and supporting links. However, it also reads like many programming blogs: substance over aesthetics.

Whether it’s a product update, article, tutorial, webinar, or interview, PyCharm has consistently published a handful of new posts each month for years. While there are quite a bit of company promotions and sales plugs, there is an abundance of insightful information. Even outright sales pitches have references to Python fundamentals, user guides, and an overview of programming concepts necessary to use the product. Because most posts are primarily video/audio recordings or short-form text, there isn’t much writing to be evaluated. Still, what’s there has no glaring marks or inaccuracies, and supporting links are plentiful.

The subject matter may be useful to some, but it’s hit or miss, depending on whether your objective is information or function. The posts, dating back to 2006, sufficiently demonstrate working proficiency and understanding of existing and new updates as they affect current programming. The content, typically at least 1-2 sporadic posts per month, is clean and to the point with reliable in-text links to supporting references.

### 21. [SkillSoft](https://www.skillsoft.com/blog?search=python)

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/skillsoft)

SkillSoft is an educational software company that produces learning management systems and content. Python-related topics on the blog only extend a few years back. However, the company has been around since the late ’90s, and you can find more relevant programming content closer to then. Even so, you shouldn’t expect a new post with any sort of regularity.

As a blog from an established tech company, it’s not surprising that the writing quality is excellent and pushes relatively little company promotion. From a technical standpoint, posts offer valuable content with extensive detail. While SkillSoft doesn’t publish quite as much content as other blogs, the articles they do have are modern, insightful, and actionable.

### 22. [Python Central](https://www.pythoncentral.io/)

[RSS](https://www.pythoncentral.io/feed), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/PythonCentral)

Python Central is an educational Python programming hub with a wide assortment of categories. The videos and tutorials are great for any beginner or intermediate programmer but lack much depth for experienced developers. While the articles provide functional (sometimes boring) examples, the occasional errors can be distracting. There’s solid information dating back to 2012 for anyone looking to learn the fundamentals.

The Python Guru is a multi-dimensional programming resource that combines both backend developer guides and web content’ listicles.’ Started in 2019, Python Guru is a newer blog and admittedly a work-in-progress. The publishing schedule, if one exists yet, is sporadic: sometimes more than a dozen new posts appear in a month. Other months? Zilch. While the posts show technical understanding and experience in the subject matter, the grammar has room for improvement.

**Overall Score: 3.0**

This concludes my quest to identify, analyze, and rank the best Python blogs in 2024. While my grading system may not be perfect, it allowed me to assign some numerical value to each blog and let the data do the talking. It’s a satisfying approach for the technical blogger in me.

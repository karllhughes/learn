According to recent statistics, there are over 5,523 [digital marketing agencies](https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/digital-advertising-agencies-united-states/) in the United States. With a growth rate of 12.2% a year, marketing is a massive industry that covers various niches and fields. Agencies use a wide variety of tactics to help their clients succeed, and one of the most universally popular is content marketing.

Content marketing is an [important core strategy](https://www.investisdigital.com/blog/performance-marketing/how-much-does-content-marketing-cost) for B2B enterprises of all sizes. It allows organizations to scale their web presence, attract qualified leads, and engage with their audience in an authentic manner.

It doesn't take a rocket scientist to make content marketing work for you. However, it can take a good deal of time, money, and effort, particularly when done in-house. That's why more than [62% of companies](https://www.zerys.com/content-marketing-blog-0/content-marketing-agency) choose to outsource their content marketing to an expert in their industry.

There are two main outsourcing options to choose from: freelancers and content marketing agencies. While freelancers can be more cost-effective, they aren't always available when you need them and may not have the industry expertise to do everything you want. For this reason, finding an agency with experience in your industry takes the guesswork out of content marketing and will go a long way to ensuring a beneficial campaign.

Choosing the right content marketing agency can take a long time. Focusing on agencies in your industry will help to make the process smoother.

Let's look at:

* The benefits of hiring an agency with vertical experience
* Signs of a stellar agency
* Top agencies by vertical
* Making the final decision

## The Benefits of Hiring an Agency with Vertical Experience

It's always possible to hire a 'generalized' content marketing agency. These businesses serve a wide variety of clientele and use similar industry tactics across each specialization.

While generalized content marketing still offers value, umbrella services may not always be enough to move the needle. The companies we work with at [Draft.dev](https://draft.dev) require very in-depth technical content, which only experts can write. With the right budget, businesses can offload content marketing responsibilities on a team of experts offering customized strategies.

Agencies with in-depth vertical experience can:

* Focus solely on your niche
* Push campaigns with proven results
* Repair weaknesses in your campaign

## Signs of a Stellar Agency

Before dedicating budget to a content marketing agency, you'll want to make sure that you're choosing a partner for long-term results. You need to watch out for [marketing agency dealbreakers](https://draft.dev/learn/dealbreakers-when-working-with-an-saas-marketing-agency).  Just because an agency works within your niche doesn't mean they'll be the best fit for the job.

Here are a couple of [tell-tale signs](https://medium.com/scale-magazine/6-signs-of-a-truly-good-digital-marketing-agency-3655ce8e26b3) that the agency in your niche has what it takes to make a difference:

* Good reviews
* Solid case studies
* Self-application of strategies
* Measurable results and metrics

Has more than one agency caught your eye? Some investigative journalism could help to eliminate tie-breakers. After all, the most significant difference between good agencies and great agencies begins with testimonials. What are people saying about their experiences? Would they recommend the agency to others? If possible, chat with a prior client directly.

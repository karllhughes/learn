The term "DevOps" seems to be everywhere these days, but I've found that understanding what it truly means and how it's applied in practice can be surprisingly tricky. It's a broad term that touches on everything from cultural philosophies and automation tools to specific practices like continuous integration and infrastructure as code. It can mean different things to different teams and organizations.

![DevOps](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs1.png "DevOps")

To help you learn more about this versatile field, I've put together a list of some of the best DevOps blogs out there. These are the blogs that I turn to when I want clear explanations, consistent quality, real technical depth, and practical advice. Whether you're a DevOps pro or just starting to explore this world, I'm confident you'll find value in these blogs.

Before we dive into the details of each blog, here's a quick overview of the 27 best DevOps blogs I've uncovered:

### 1. [Arrested DevOps](https://www.arresteddevops.com/)

![Arrested DevOps](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs8.png "Arrested DevOps")

While not strictly a blog, the Arrested DevOps podcast was one of the first that I listened to when I started getting interested in DevOps. They have had nearly every big name in the industry on as a guest at one point or another, and if there is a specific topic you want to learn about, you shouldn’t have a problem finding at least one episode dedicated to that in the archives. If you prefer to learn by listening instead of by reading, definitely check out this podcast.

### 2. [The Microsoft Azure Blog](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/)

As one of the three major cloud providers, the Azure blog doesn’t focus exclusively on DevOps topics, but has a ton of news and information related to cloud computing in general and Azure services in particular. If you use Azure as your cloud provider, this is an especially good blog to follow and if it’s not, it’s always good to learn about what’s possible on other platforms.

Total Score: 4.8

### 3. [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/devops/)

![The Register](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs7.png "The Register")

If you’re looking for more news than tutorials or documentation, The Register’s DevOps blog is for you. It’s heavily focused on industry news (with some of the snarkiest headlines I’ve ever seen) and has little in the way of tutorials. However, it is one of the best DevOps blogs I’ve found for keeping up with what’s going on in the industry from a broader business perspective.

Total Score: 4.6

### 4. [Google Cloud DevOps and SRE Blog](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre)

As another of the big three cloud providers, it makes sense that Google also has a blog sharing their thoughts on DevOps. While many of the articles here are specific to Google Cloud services and offerings, they also have more general content and case studies.

* Writing Quality - 5
* Consistency - 4
* Longevity - 4

Total Score: 4.4

### 5. [DevOps.com](https://devops.com/)

![DevOps.com](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs10.png "DevOps.com")

Besides having the canonical .com domain name, DevOps.com is a blog with extremely diverse content. With categories ranging from DevSecOps to Continuous Delivery to Leadership Suite to a DevOps-themed comic, there’s something for everyone here.

Total Score: 4.4

### 6. [The Puppet Blog](https://puppet.com/resources/)

As one of the original DevOps tools and the publisher of the annual State of DevOps report, Puppet is uniquely positioned to comment on happenings and new developments in DevOps. Their blog contains a wide range of content, from reports and case studies to webinars, all very well put together and detailed.

Total Score: 4.4

### 7. [Code as Craft](https://codeascraft.com/)

![Code as Craft](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs11.png "Code as Craft")

The Etsy engineering blog, Code as Craft, has detailed posts about some of the challenges that the Etsy engineering team has had to take on as they scale as well as more general DevOps and engineering-focused articles. Because their articles are based on learnings that come out of running a large engineering team, they are an interesting look into how DevOps concepts are applied at a large and fast-moving organization.

Total Score: 4.4

### 8. [DevOps Weekly](https://www.devopsweekly.com/)

DevOps Weekly is an email newsletter rather than a blog. If you prefer to have a roundup of content delivered to your email inbox instead of reading many different blogs, definitely check this one out.

### 9. [The Docker Blog](https://www.docker.com/blog/)

![The Docker Blog](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs2.png "The Docker Blog")

Docker was one of the early tools that inspired and even enabled much of the other DevOps tooling available today. Their blog has been published very consistently since 2013 and has some good technical deep dives on Docker tooling and use cases. There are posts about other topics on this blog as well, but because it is mostly Docker-specific, I took off a couple of points for broad usefulness. However, if you use Docker or any tools that are based on Docker (which is very likely), there’s a lot to learn here.

* Consistency - 5
* Longevity - 5
* Technical Depth - 4

Total Score: 4.2

### 10. [The Atlassian DevOps Blog](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/devops)

Atlassian has been making developer and developer-adjacent tooling for years, and as part of that mission, has been shaping the industry. While many of the posts on their blog are Atlassian-specific, they do also have more general content.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 4
* Longevity - 5
* Technical Depth - 4
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score: 4.2

### 11. [dev.to DevOps](https://dev.to/t/devops)

Dev.to is another site where users can submit articles and content to the community who can react and comment. In that way, you’re more likely to see personal stories and case studies here, but the content varies widely and you can sort by posts that the community has determined are the “top posts” or browse the latest content.

Total Score: 4.2

### 12. [High Scalability Blog](https://highscalability.com/)

![High Scalability Blog](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs9.png "High Scalability Blog")

This DevOps website grew to prominence when it published some prominent case studies, but it also has a broad range of content specifically targeted towards running systems and projects at a huge scale. Many times, this knowledge is locked away behind NDAs and other restrictions, but the posts here are illuminating as to how some of the biggest companies in our industry manage that scale.

* Writing Quality - 5
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 4
* Technical Depth - 5
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score: 4.2

### 13. [IT Revolution](https://itrevolution.com/)

IT Revolution was started by Gene Kim, author of The Phoenix Project and The Unicorn Project (great reads that didn’t make the list because they’re books instead of blogs). Far from the technical focus of most of the blogs on this list, IT Revolution focuses more on concepts like leadership and how to drive the adoption of DevOps principles. These “soft skills” are just as important as the more technical concepts, and IT Revolution helps emphasize that.

Total Score: 4.2

### 14. [DevOps Stack Exchange](https://devops.stackexchange.com/)

The DevOps Stack Exchange is a Q&A site specific to DevOps. However, the questions on the DevOps Stack Exchange tend to be more technical and more narrowly scoped, such as dealing with specific error messages of a specific tool.  If you have a question about a specific DevOps tool, it’s likely your Google search would lead you here anyway. But keep in mind that, browsing the site without a specific question can be a good way to find out what tools others are using and what problems they are struggling with.

### 15. [DevOps Multireddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/obitechnobi/m/devops/)

If one subreddit about DevOps isn’t enough for you, Reddit user obitechnobi has created a collection of 35 subreddits encompassing everything from r/devops to r/linux and r/serverless and plenty more in between, all collected in one place. As I said in our other Reddit entry on this list, because all of this content is user-submitted, quality can vary. However, if you wanted the most variety of content from following just one of the links in our list, this one would be it.

### 16. [Digital.ai](https://digital.ai/learn/resources/?_resource_topic=devops)

![Digital.ai](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs4.png "Digital.ai")

Digital.ai has a wide-ranging blog covering many different topics, but they have some great webinars and case studies specifically focused on DevOps. They initially got on my radar when they produced the [Periodic Table of DevOps](https://digital.ai/periodic-table-of-devops-tools), which is “the industry’s go-to resource for identifying best-of-breed tools across the software delivery lifecycle.”

* Writing Quality - 4

Total Score: 4

### 17. [The VMWare Tanzu Blog](https://tanzu.vmware.com/content/devops)

Tanzu is one of VMWare’s Ops platforms, and as such, they have an entire blog dedicated to DevOps topics. One of the main differences between this DevOps blog and some of the others in this list is that there are many different content types including video, slides, podcasts, webinars, as well as the more traditional text blog post.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 5
* Longevity - 4
* Technical Depth - 3
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score: 4

### 18. [The Amazon Web Services (AWS) Blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/devops/)

AWS is arguably the most prominent cloud platform in the industry today and its infrastructure powers many DevOps workflows in all sorts of industries. Similar to the Azure blog, many of the articles on their blog are AWS-specific. Even though there are so many services, AWS DevOps blog content can be incredibly diverse even while still being AWS-focused.

* Writing Quality - 4.5
* Consistency - 5
* Longevity - 4

Total Score: 4

### 19. [The Cloudflare Blog](https://blog.cloudflare.com/)

![The Cloudflare Blog](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs12.png "The Cloudflare Blog")

Cloudflare has become a last-mile infrastructure provider for many of the internet’s biggest web properties by providing caching, CDN, and other performance-enhancing offerings. This  is one of the best DevOps blogs for learning about the different technologies they’re bringing to market (many of which are also supported by other providers).

* Writing Quality - 4

* Broad Usefulness - 3

Total Score: 4

### 20. [The Accenture DevOps Blog](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/software-engineering-blog/devops-index)

Many companies who don’t maintain a developer team of the size they need in-house have turned to Accenture for consulting and support. As a result, they’ve taken some of what they’ve learned and have shared it on their DevOps blog. The articles here range from technical deep dives on Kubernetes to more general discussions of methodology around a DevOps transition.

* Writing Quality - 5
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 3
* Technical Depth - 4
* Broad Usefulness - 5

Total Score: 4

### 21. [DevOps Cube](https://devopscube.com/)

This is probably the DevOps website with the most wide-ranging content, both in the diversity of topic selection and intended audience, from beginner to expert. It has only been around for a couple years, but has built up a large knowledge base that’s a great reference when you start working with a new tool or a new concept.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 5
* Longevity - 3
* Technical Depth - 3
* Broad Usefulness - 5

Total Score: 4

### 22. [DevOps Topic on Quora](https://www.quora.com/topic/DevOps)

Quora is a question-and-answer site where users can post questions, and anyone from another user on a site to a vetted expert can chime in with their opinion. Like Reddit and some of the other entries in this list, all the content here is user-generated, making it great to find out what people are talking about and wondering about in the industry.

* Writing Quality - 3
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 4
* Technical Depth - 4
* Broad Usefulness - 5

Total Score: 3.8

### 23. [Microsoft DevOps Blog](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/)

![Microsoft DevOps Blog](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs5.png "Microsoft DevOps Blog")

While this is the second entry from Microsoft, it’s a bit more general than the Azure-specific blog mentioned earlier in the roundup. The posts here come from “the team building Azure DevOps,” and they are a mix of news, best practices and some technical content, although they tend to be more general.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 4
* Longevity - 4
* Technical Depth - 3
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score: 3.8

### 24. [The Netflix Tech Blog](https://netflixtechblog.com/tagged/devops)

Similar to the Etsy blog mentioned above, Netflix also shares learnings from their Engineering team on their tech blog. The DevOps category is well-stocked and details everything from security to some of their open-source projects.

* Writing Quality - 4
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 3
* Technical Depth - 5
* Broad Usefulness - 4

Total Score: 3.8

### 25. [r/devops](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/)

There are subreddits for almost any technical specialization you can think of, and DevOps is no exception. On r/devops, you’ll find a mix of blog articles, questions from other readers, and discussions about topics pertinent to the industry. The caveat here is that all the content on r/devops is user-submitted, and while that’s great for getting real-world perspective, it also means that much of what’s posted are opinions that should not always be taken as fact.

* Writing Quality - 3
* Consistency - 3
* Longevity - 3

### 26. [The All Day DevOps Blog](https://www.alldaydevops.com/blog)

![The All Day DevOps Blog](/learn/assets/posts/best-devops-blogs6.png "The All Day DevOps Blog")

All Day DevOps is an annual event (now virtual as of 2020), and their blog serves as a hub for content related to the conference. Here you'll find recaps of talks, articles from community members, interviews, and even some technical deep dives. Since the blog is primarily focused on the yearly event, don't expect a regular publishing schedule, but there's always a wealth of past content to explore.

Total Score: 3.6

### 27. [Sourced Blog](https://www.sourcedgroup.com/resources/)

The Sourced blog (previously known as The DevOps Group) has made DevOps their entire business, and they use their blog to educate potential customers and share their thoughts with others in the industry. This DevOps website is a bit more general than some of the others covered in this list. However, for someone new to the sector, their site provides a great starting point on many topics.

* Writing Quality - 3

* Longevity - 5
* Technical Depth - 3

Total Score: 3.6

As you can see, there is no shortage of people talking about DevOps and trying to keep up with the changes in the industry. Hopefully in the list above you’ve found a new resource or two that you’ll refer back to in the future.
